# Ephemeral Server

Hosting as you need it.

Provides a wrapper around `terraform` and `ansible` that will automatically install
a variety of programs onto a virtual private server (on AWS or Digital Ocean). Programs are installed onto a
persistent volume that persist after the more expensive VPS is shut down.
